# Software Development Kit for ctrlX AUTOMATION

This is the software development kit (SDK) for [ctrlX AUTOMATION](https://www.ctrlx-automation.com). It can be used to program Apps for ctrlX CORE.

Browse through the manual via: [ctrlX AUTOMATION Software Development Kit](https://boschrexroth.github.io/ctrlx-automation-sdk)

> [!NOTE]  
> This is a fork with custom changes/fixes, see [https://github.com/boschrexroth/ctrlx-automation-sdk](https://github.com/boschrexroth/ctrlx-automation-sdk) for the original code!

> [!WARNING]
> The SDK seems to not easily work on `Ubuntu 24`, so only use it on `Ubuntu 22.04`. Even though the [official documentation here](https://boschrexroth.github.io/ctrlx-automation-sdk/latest/setup_windows_virtualbox_ubuntu.html) explicitely references `Ubuntu 22.04`, the instructions listed there only partially work. See the comments below for hints on how to fix.
>
> A good source of information is the [ctrlx-automation-sdk/blob/main/scripts/environment/cloud-config](https://github.com/ogsadmin/ctrlx-automation-sdk/blob/main/scripts/environment/cloud-config) file in the repo, check additionally (e.g. for the list of packages to install).

## Bugs and known issues

This section is relevant for SDK V3.6 and OS version V3.6.1 (automation core V3.6.1).

## Hints

The following might come in handy to debug your snaps on a physical device:

- Request root access to the CtrlX device: 
- Show the snap logs:
	- connect over ssh and run `snap logs <snapname> -f` to get realtime logs
	- configure syslog and point to your syslog collector
- Run an interactive shell inside the snap container:
	1. ssh into the device
	2. run `snap run --shell <snapname>` 
	
- App application data cleanup

  Uninstalling an application does not clean up the application data folder at `/var/snap/rexroth-solutions/common/solutions/DefaultSolution/configurations/appdata/<appname>`. If the layout of the app data changes (or some mistake happens during development), then this must be deleted manually. 

## Installation of the App Build Environment

__To develop ctrlX Apps we recommend to use a ctrlX App Build Environment.__ Otherwise a Ubuntu Server or Desktop system is needed.

How to create and start a ctrlX App Build Environment is described in [ctrlX WORKS App Build Environment](https://boschrexroth.github.io/ctrlx-automation-sdk/setup_qemu_ctrlx_works.html)

If your ctrlX App Build Environment is running, you can log in and install the ctrlX AUTOMATION SDK - see below.

## Installation of the ctrlX AUTOMATION SDK

__These installation steps are required on both an App Build Environment and an Ubuntu Server or Desktop System.__

> [!NOTE]  
> The following instructions seem to only only work, if the commands are executed from the users root folder (`/home/boschrexroth/`)! Do not install in a subfolder, else the datalayer .deb package install fails.

> [!NOTE]  
> Snapcraft uses LXC-containers managed through `lxd`. By default this requires root access (sudo) for building. To fix this, add your user to the `lxd` group as follows
>
>   sudo usermod -a -G lxd $USER
>
> Then you can remove the `sudo` calls in the samples build scripts.

### Clone and Install the ctrlX AUTOMATION SDK

Start a console session, change to your destination directory and enter:

	wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/boschrexroth/ctrlx-automation-sdk/main/scripts/clone-install-sdk.sh && chmod a+x *.sh && ./clone-install-sdk.sh

As a result, your local copy of the github repo is stored within the directory __ctrlx-automation-sdk/__

> [!NOTE]  
> NOTE: The script will ask for the github tag to use for installing - enter the version as shown in the list, e.g. `2.6.7`, then hit enter (also for the next question)

### Install required Debian packages

Stay in the directory and enter:

	ctrlx-automation-sdk/scripts/install-required-packages.sh

### Install snapcraft

Stay in the directory and enter:

	ctrlx-automation-sdk/scripts/install-snapcraft.sh

### Install ctrlx-datalayer Debian package

Stay in the directory and enter:

	ctrlx-automation-sdk/scripts/install-ctrlx-datalayer.sh ctrlx-automation-sdk/deb

### Building Sample Projects

Now you are able to build the C++ and Python sample projects.

To build sample projects in other programming languages further installation steps are required.

Change to the directory `ctrlx-automation-sdk/scripts` and start the according install script.

For go samples:

	install-go.sh

> [!WARNING]  
> The `install-dotnet-sdk.sh` script seem to not work for Ubuntu 22.04, as the script downloads a debian package, which breaks the Ubuntu 22 provided packages. Here is how to officially install the `dotnet 8.0.411` framework and sdk: [Install DotNet 8 for Ubuntu 22](https://learn.microsoft.com/de-de/dotnet/core/install/linux-ubuntu-install?tabs=dotnet8&pivots=os-linux-ubuntu-2204).
> Use the following instead:
	
	sudo apt-get install -y dotnet-sdk-8.0 aspnetcore-runtime-8.0 dotnet-runtime-8.0

For .NET samples (**MIGHT NEED TO REINSTALL DOTNET AS SHOWN ABOVE**):

	install-dotnet-sdk.sh

> [!NOTE]
> To develop on windows and linux in parallel, make sure to delete the `nuget.config` file from the C# samples (this is not used by VS2022 and VSCode/dotnet correctly resolves the packages references (nowadays) correctly anyway). 
>
> To use the datalyer on windows, make sure to download/install the OpenSSH libraries.


> [!TIP]
> The [hard to find DotNET class library documentation](https://apps.boschrexroth.com/docs/ctrlx/csharp/html/files.html)
>
> The [official .NET Apps @ctrlX documentation](https://boschrexroth.github.io/ctrlx-automation-sdk/latest/dotnet.html)

For nodejs samples:

	install-nodejs-npm.sh
